### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*
Setting: Anywhere an opaque door seperates two rooms

Players: Two humans who are capable of moving through a door.

Activity: Both are about to open the door at approximately the same time.

Goals: Get through the door without accidentally hitting the other person.


\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
Concerns were about it being unclear about what is actually happening on the other side of the door. How can we make a warning that doesn't feel threatening?


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*


## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*


## Part D. Wizard the device

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*
I don't understand the difference.


## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*


## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
